# How-does-ICSI-improve-IVF-success-for-male-infertility-

Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) is a specialized IVF technique where a single sperm is directly injected into an egg. It is especially helpful in cases of male infertility caused by low sperm count, poor motility, or abnormal morphology. ICSI increases the chances of fertilization by bypassing the natural barriers sperm usually face. Though fertilization does not guarantee pregnancy, ICSI significantly boosts overall IVF success rates for many couples. It is also commonly used in cases of unexplained infertility or previous failed fertilization attempts. Trinity IVF Ahmedabad provides expert ICSI treatment tailored to patient needs.
